// Merge Sort is a stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works well with linked lists and arrays.
// Its time complexity is O(n log n) in all cases, making it a reliable choice for sorting large datasets.
// Java's `Collections.sort()` and Python's `sorted()` use Timsort, which is derived from Merge Sort.
// It is comparison-based and can be implemented using recursion or iteration.
