// Quick Sort is exceptionally well-suited for arrays, and this is where it truly shines. 
// Its time complexity is O(n log n) on average, making it efficient for large datasets.
// However, in the worst case, it can degrade to O(n^2), especially if the pivot selection is poor.
// STD::sort in C++ uses a hybrid approach, often combining Quick Sort with other algorithms 
// like Heap Sort or Insertion Sort for better performance.
// It is comparison-based and can be implemented using recursion or iteration.
