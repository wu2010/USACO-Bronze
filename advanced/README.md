## Operators

[The following table shows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/cpp-built-in-operators-precedence-and-associativity?view=msvc-170) the precedence and associativity of C++ operators (from highest to lowest precedence). Operators with the same precedence number have equal precedence unless another relationship is explicitly forced by parentheses. 

High precedence operators include: 

Group 1 precedence, no associativity	
- Scope resolution	(`::`)

Group 2 precedence, left to right associativity
- Function call (`()`)
- Array subscripting (`[]`)
- Member access (`.` and `->`)

Group 3 precedence, right to left associativity	
- Object creation (`new`) and destruction (`delete`)
- Pointer dereference (`*`) and address-of (`&`)

- Bitwise AND (`&`), XOR (`^`), OR (`|`)
